Step 1: Launch Manzanita MP2TSME from your desktop or start menu. You will see the main window of the software, which consists of four tabs: Input, Output, Options and Log. The Input tab allows you to select the elementary streams that you want to multiplex into a transport stream. The Output tab allows you to specify the name and location of the output transport stream file. The Options tab allows you to configure various settings for the multiplexing process, such as bitrate, buffer size, PID allocation, etc. The Log tab displays the status and progress of the multiplexing process.
 
Step 2: In the Input tab, click on the Add button to browse and select the elementary streams that you want to include in your transport stream. You can add video streams (MPEG-2, H.264 or HEVC), audio streams (MPEG-1 Layer II, AC-3 or AAC) or data streams (DVB subtitles, teletext or SCTE-35). You can also drag and drop files from your file explorer to the input list. You can add up to 32 elementary streams per transport stream.
 
Step 3: After adding the elementary streams, you can edit their properties by selecting them and clicking on the Edit button. A new window will open where you can change the stream type, PID value, language code, descriptor tags and other parameters. You can also preview the stream content by clicking on the Play button. Click on OK when you are done editing.

You can also enable or disable features such as null packet insertion, PCR correction, continuity counter correction and SCTE-35 cue insertion.
 
Step 6: When you are ready to start multiplexing, click on the Start button at the bottom of the main window. The multiplexing process will begin and you can monitor its status and progress in the Log tab. You can also pause or stop the multiplexing process at any time by clicking on the Pause or Stop buttons.
 
Step 7: When the multiplexing process is completed, you will see a message in the Log tab indicating that your output transport stream file has been created successfully. You can then open it with any compatible player or analyzer to check its content and quality.
